# **Main**

Fishman et al. (2001) build a genetic linkage map of an interspecific cross between *M. guttatus* and *M.nasutus*. At that time, the $F_2$ mapping population used (*N*=526) were genotyped for 174 markers. Based on this study, the authors have found a genetic map of 2011-2096 cM Kosambi size, containing 174 marker loci distribuited over 14 linkage group. 

Here we incorporate new genomic information onto the Fishman's map in order to update the new loci information. By using a new data set of the same population with 418 markers, we founded 388 new loci and expanded the maps to a lenght of 2933.95 cM Kosambi.

For more details about the procedures founded in this paper, also the strategies to build a genetic linkage map using *OneMap R-package*, please check our youtube video here[].

# **Material and Methods**

**Genetic Material:** A cross between *Mimulus guttatus* (outcrossing) x *Mimus nasutus* (selfing) originated an F$_{2}$ population discribed in Fishman et al. (2001). This population were composed by 287 individuals genotyped with 418 markers. For more details see Fishman et al. (2001).

**Genetic linkage map:** We applied a segregation test to observe if there were distorted markers (Figure 1). The null-hypotesis ($H_0$) tested was segregation pattern of *1:2:1*, as expected for a F$_{2}$ population. To construct a linkage map, we made two-point tests with all markers, considering *LOD score* = 6 and the maximum recombination fraction $\theta = 0.35$ and created a non-ordered sequence with all markers. Then, we used the function group to assign markes to linkage groups. We repeated this procedure three more times, changing the maximum recombination fraction ($\theta_{max}$) to 0.5 and 0.25 with *LOD* = 6, respectively, and 0.35 with *LOD* = 7.  
Considering *ad hoc* information, the analysis continued with the strategy that resulted in the highest number of linkage groups. Makers were ordered between the 14 linkage groups by the function *make_seq* and then ordered the markers within each group with function *order_seq*. All the markers that were mapped in more than one position were added by the function *make_seq*, using the argument '*force*', which assigned to the most probable position. After that, the same analysis was performed with non-distorted markers. 
Observing heatmaps for each linkage group, it was possible to check which markers should be removed, because they do not follow the recombination fraction pattern. These makers were removed using the function *drop_markers*. We followed the same pipeline discribed above, without those markers. 
Lastly, a final ordering was applied for each linkage group using *ripple_seq* function, considering a window size of five markers.
We draw the genetic map with MapChart.

 **Software**:The data was disposed in a MAPMAKER file and the linkage map was built using OneMap package (Margarido et al, 2007). We draw the genetic maps using MapChart software (Vorrips et al 2002).

# **Results**

The segregation pattern observed is presented in Figure 1. A total of 14 linkage groups were formed (Figure 2), which agrees to the haploid number of chromosomes. 
The genetic map drawn with MapChart is presented in Figure 3.
